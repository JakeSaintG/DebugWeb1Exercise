# Web 1 Debug Exercise!
Fork this repo and pull it down to your local machine to get started!

## Set up
One of the interns approaches you with a few concerns with the new profile app that your team has been working on. They show you the mock and express concerns that their end product looks nothing like it. They want you, one of the team's Junior Developers, to sit down with them and figure out why it looks wrong. They are so close!

## Intructions:
There are 6 issues with this Profile web application that is causing it to not look like the mock that UX/UI gave your intern. In addition to some of them being style issues, the client is also supposed to be listed as "Looking for work". None of these issues require a major re-write and should be pretty small tweaks. Poke around the code and try to find at least 4 out of the 6 issues.

In addition to the 5 issues, there are 2 bonus questions that your intern has asked you:
- Why isn't the Submit button working like one would expect?
- The trailing comma on the Skills section feels off. What's a clever way to get rid of it?

## REMEMBER!
Developers work in a team. In this team, you have a couple of Senior Devs that you can reach out to if you get stuck. Your mentors won't directly answer the question like a Senior Dev might in a real team, but they may point you in the right direction.

## The 5 issues
Note that line numbers may have changed from the main branch:

CSS:
1. Borders everywhere! 
2. Missing bracket in CSS
3. Why is the menu not in the right spot?

HTML:
4. Broken image in HTML
5. Make the site show that Misha is "Looking for work". Will accept hard coding "Looking for work" but we prefer to see it indexed appropriately. 

JS:
6. Unlinked JS file

BONUS:
1. Looping is not the best way to handle building that string. Joining is simpler any way!
2. Button is of type "Submit" which has the default behavior of reloading the page.
